		    <li>The defanation of HTML is as markup language which is a simple way of annotating a document</li>
            <li>Client-server model of communications is a request and a response model which mean that as a client i ancient request to the server and response back to client</li>
            <li>types of servers
                <ul>
                    <li>Email Server</li>
                    <li>Data Server </li>
                    <li>Web Server  </li>
                    <li>Application Server </li>
                    <li>Media Server </li>
                    <li>Authentication Server</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Web server is a fundamental level which is computer respond to http request </li>
            <li>Data Centers is a special facility that holds a farm of server computers</li>
            <li>We need URL to allow the client to ask for specific response from the server</li>
            <li>An example of URL is https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/leaders-debate-preview-1.6167617
                <ul>
                    <li>https: is the protocol</li>
                    <li>www.cbc.ca: domain</li>
                    <li>news/politics/: path</li>
                    <li>leaders-debate-preview: query string </li>
                    <li>1.6167617: Fragment</li>

                </ul>
            <li>The main difference between static and dynamic that dynamic will vary for each client or user and static will be the same for all users or clients</li>
            <li>We need DNS because it's harder to for people to use long strings of numbers amd it's easier to remember names and the dns know how to translate name(url) to ip</li>
            <li>The process of DNS address resolution is: once the client has inout a website name in his browser the browser will check if in it  DNS cache has the
                ip address of that website if not it will go to the primary DNS server of the isp and if it doesn't have in the cache it will foreword it to root server DNS and it will
                return the top level domain and request the ip address of server from there and return it to the primary dns server and will request for ip
                for the server of the website and return it back to the client threw the primary dns sever
            </li>
            <li>Examples of gTLD domains are:
            <ul>
                <li>.com</li>
                <li>.net</li>
                <li>.org</li>
                <li>.info</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Examples of gTLD domains are:
                <ul>
                    <li>.co.uk</li>
                    <li>.ca</li>
                    <li>.de</li>
                    <li>.cn</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>The purpose of the HTTP is to establish connection on port 80 in tcp protocol once a
                connection established with the server send code ,headers and optional content response back to client. </li>
            <li>A single web page will display on the browser by the client make a request for a html page then it will
                get parsed html back to find all resources like files, images and styles once all resources received it will
                show that to the client.
            </li>
            <li>Examples of HTTP request methods are:
            <ul>
                <li>Get</li>
                <li>POST</li>
                <li>HEAD </li>
                <li>PUT</li>
                <li>DELETE</li>
                <li>CONNECT</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>
